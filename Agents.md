## Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit:
1. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Test**: `npm test`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 70%

**Order matters.** Lint → Build → Test. Never skip steps.

---

## 🚨 Code Consistency Mandate (CRITICAL)

**Read `genesis/CODE-CONSISTENCY-MANDATE.md` before touching any code.**

**The Rule**: Every file MUST match hello-world exactly, except document-type-specific files.

**Run `project-diff` REPEATEDLY during development:**

```bash
cd genesis/project-diff
node diff-projects.js --ci
# Expected: ✓ ALL MUST-MATCH FILES ARE IDENTICAL
```

**Why**: We fixed 52 divergent files in February 2026 because AI assistants made "helpful improvements" that broke consistency. Never again.

## Communication Rules

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

**Banned phrases**: production-grade, world-class, leverage, utilize, incredibly, extremely, Happy to help!

## 🚨 Progressive Module Loading

**STOP and load the relevant module BEFORE these actions:**

### Language Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/javascript.md`
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.go` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/go.md`
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.sh` file or bash code block**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/shell.md`

### Workflow Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE any commit, PR, push, or merge**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/security.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN tests fail OR after 2+ failed fix attempts**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/testing.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN build fails OR lint errors appear**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/build-hygiene.md`
- 🟡 **BEFORE deploying to any environment**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/deployment.md`
- 🟡 **WHEN conversation exceeds 50 exchanges**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/context-management.md`

### Project type guidance:
- Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/project-types/genesis-tools.md`

### Optional: Superpowers integration

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Adversarial Workflow Pattern (CRITICAL)

All document-generation apps MUST:
- Generate prompts for external AI services (NOT auto-generate AI responses)
- Implement the 7-step workflow pattern (see `docs/ADVERSARIAL-WORKFLOW-PATTERN.md`)
- Have "Copy Prompt" buttons (NOT "Generate with AI" buttons)
- Use different AIs for different phases (Claude → Gemini → Claude)

### Language-Specific Commands

```bash
# Go (genesis-validator/)
cd genesis-validator && make test lint

# JavaScript (all 7 projects)
npm run lint && npm run test:coverage
```

### Coverage Targets

| Language | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Go | ≥80% |
| JavaScript | ≥85% statements, ≥80% branches |

### project-diff Tool (Code Consistency)

```bash
# Run consistency check across all 7 projects
cd genesis/project-diff
node diff-projects.js --ci

# Find orphaned files
node find-orphans.js --ci
```

See [`project-diff/README.md`](project-diff/README.md) for documentation.

### AI Slop Detection (All Projects)

All validators include `slop-detection.js` with 150+ patterns to detect AI-generated content:
- Generic boosters, buzzwords, filler phrases
- Formulaic structures and over-signposting
- Em-dashes (classic AI marker)

When creating new projects, copy `slop-detection.js` from hello-world and integrate into validator.

### About.md Convention

When conducting Perplexity research for a new genesis project, save the Q&A as `docs/About.md`.
This establishes foundational research that informs the validator and prompt design.
