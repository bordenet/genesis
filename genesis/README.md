## What is Genesis?

Genesis is a **comprehensive project template system** that abstracts the Product Requirements Assistant into reusable, AI-readable templates. It enables rapid creation of derivative projects with similar architecture but different workflows.

**Success Criteria**: Copy `genesis/` to empty repo → AI reads instructions → Creates fully working project with GitHub Pages deployment in <2 hours.

## Quick Start

### For AI Assistants (PRIMARY)

This is your ONLY entry point. It contains:
- Complete step-by-step execution plan (30-60 minutes)
- All mandatory files to read (with direct links)
- Exact commands to run
- Success criteria and verification steps

**DO NOT** read other files until `START-HERE.md` tells you to.

### For Humans

1. **Read quick start**: `02-QUICK-START.md`
2. **Choose an example**: See `examples/` directory
3. **Customize**: See `03-CUSTOMIZATION-GUIDE.md`
