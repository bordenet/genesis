# AI Execution Checklist

**For AI Assistants**: Use this checklist to verify you've completed all steps from START-HERE.md

---

## ⚠️ BEFORE YOU START (MANDATORY)

**DO NOT PROCEED** until you've completed these prerequisite steps:

- [ ] Read `REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`
- [ ] Study https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant ⭐ **PRIMARY REFERENCE**
  - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Read `docs/index.html` lines 9-15 - Tailwind dark mode config (ALWAYS BROKEN WITHOUT THIS!)
  - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Read `docs/js/app.js` lines 145-165 - Dark mode toggle functions (loadTheme, toggleTheme)
  - [ ] Read `js/workflow.js` - Phase architecture, prompt loading, data flow
  - [ ] Read `js/app.js` - Form rendering, phase transitions, UI logic
  - [ ] Read `prompts/phase1.md` - Prompt template with variables
  - [ ] Read `templates/prd-template.md` - Document structure
  - [ ] Read `tests/workflow.test.js` - Testing async prompts
  - [ ] Read `scripts/deploy-web.sh` - Compact mode deployment with quality gates
  - [ ] Read `scripts/setup-macos.sh` - Fast, resumable setup with smart caching
- [ ] Study https://github.com/bordenet/one-pager ⭐ **SECONDARY REFERENCE**
  - [ ] Read `index.html` - Related projects dropdown, UI patterns
  - [ ] Read `GENESIS-DARK-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Lessons learned
  - [ ] Read `GENESIS-PROCESS-IMPROVEMENTS.md` - What went wrong and how to fix it
- [ ] Read `docs/WORKFLOW-ARCHITECTURE.md` (includes dark mode implementation guide)
- [ ] Read `docs/REQUIREMENTS-TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Read `docs/WORKFLOW-DECISION-TREE.md`
- [ ] Understand the 3-phase workflow pattern (mock, manual, mock)
- [ ] Understand form-to-prompt pattern for Phase 1
- [ ] Understand template variable replacement (`{variableName}` syntax)
- [ ] Understand async prompt loading from markdown files
- [ ] Understand defensive coding patterns
- [ ] Understand mock vs. manual mode
- [ ] **Understand dark mode implementation** (Tailwind config + loadTheme + toggleTheme)
- [ ] **Understand deployment scripts** (compact mode, git output redirection)
- [ ] **Understand setup scripts** (fast, resumable, smart caching)

**Why this matters**: This will answer 90% of your questions BEFORE you ask the user. You'll know:
- ✅ **How to fix dark mode** (CRITICAL - broken in every Genesis project without Tailwind config)
- ✅ How to structure workflow phases (default: 3 phases)
- ✅ How to load prompts from markdown files (always in `prompts/` directory)
- ✅ How to handle form data and template variables
- ✅ How to implement mock mode for development
- ✅ How to write defensive code with proper validation
- ✅ How to test async functionality
- ✅ **How to write deployment scripts** (compact mode, quality gates)
- ✅ **How to write setup scripts** (fast, resumable, smart caching)

**If you skip this step, you will waste time asking questions that are already answered in the reference implementation.**

**📝 IMPORTANT**: Create `REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md` in the project root (use template from `genesis/templates/project-structure/REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES-template.md`). Every time you reference the implementations to solve a problem, add a note documenting what Genesis is missing.

---

## Step 1: Read Mandatory Files ✅

- [ ] Read `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` completely
- [ ] Read `05-QUALITY-STANDARDS.md` completely
- [ ] Read `integration/CODE_STYLE_STANDARDS.md` completely
- [ ] Read `integration/SHELL_SCRIPT_STANDARDS.md` completely
- [ ] Read `examples/hello-world/README.md` (for reference, not copying)
- [ ] Understand: ALWAYS lint, ALWAYS test, ALWAYS communicate what's left
- [ ] Understand: NEVER include node_modules/, coverage/, dist/, build/
- [ ] Understand: NEVER use hyperbolic language
- [ ] Understand: Check coding standards FIRST before creating code

---

## Step 2: Gather Requirements ✅

**Ask ONLY these essential questions** (after studying reference implementation):

- [ ] Asked user for project name
- [ ] Asked user for project title
- [ ] Asked user for one-line description
- [ ] Asked user for GitHub username
- [ ] Asked user for GitHub repo name
- [ ] Asked user for document type (e.g., "One-Pager", "PRD", "Design Doc")
- [ ] Asked user for link to document template or example (if available)
- [ ] Asked user if they want deviations from standard 3-phase workflow (default: NO)
- [ ] Stored all answers as variables for template replacement

**Did NOT ask** (inferred from reference implementation):
- [ ] Did NOT ask "How many phases?" (Default: 3)
- [ ] Did NOT ask "Should prompts be in files?" (YES - always in `prompts/`)
- [ ] Did NOT ask "Should templates be abstracted?" (YES - always in `templates/`)
- [ ] Did NOT ask "How should mock mode work?" (See product-requirements-assistant)
- [ ] Did NOT ask "Should Phase 1 have a form?" (YES - if structured doc)

---

## Step 4: Install and Test ✅

- [ ] Ran `npm install`
- [ ] Ran `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` (CRITICAL - installs pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] Verified pre-commit hook installed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- [ ] Ran `npm run lint`
- [ ] Fixed any linting errors (or ran `npm run lint:fix`)
- [ ] Verified 0 linting errors

- [ ] Verified coverage ≥70% (or ≥85% for production)
- [ ] Fixed any failing tests BEFORE proceeding
- [ ] (Optional) Ran `./scripts/setup-codecov.sh` if setting up code coverage reporting

---

## Step 5: Set Up GitHub ✅

- [ ] Ran `git init` (if needed)
- [ ] Ran `git add .`
- [ ] Ran `git commit -m "Initial commit from Genesis template"`
- [ ] User created GitHub repo (or used `gh repo create`)
- [ ] Ran `git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git`
- [ ] Ran `git branch -M main`
- [ ] Ran `git push -u origin main`
- [ ] Verified push succeeded

---

## Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages ✅

- [ ] Told user to go to repo settings → Pages
- [ ] Told user to select: Source = Deploy from branch
- [ ] Told user to select: Branch = main, Folder = / (root)
- [ ] Told user to click Save
- [ ] Told user to wait 1-2 minutes
- [ ] Told user the URL: `https://USER.github.io/REPO/`

---

## Step 7: Delete Genesis ✅

- [ ] Ran `rm -rf genesis/`
- [ ] Ran `git add .`
- [ ] Ran `git commit -m "Remove genesis template directory"`
- [ ] Ran `git push`
- [ ] Verified genesis/ is gone from repo

---

## Step 8: Test Deployment Script ✅

- [ ] Verified `scripts/deploy-web.sh` exists and is executable
- [ ] Ran `./scripts/deploy-web.sh --help` to verify help works
- [ ] Tested deployment script: `./scripts/deploy-web.sh`
- [ ] Verified script runs linting
- [ ] Verified script runs tests
- [ ] Verified script checks coverage
- [ ] Verified script pushes to GitHub
- [ ] Verified script displays deployment URL

---

## Step 9: Final Verification ✅

- [ ] App works at `https://USER.github.io/REPO/`
- [ ] All tests passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] Linting clean (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Coverage ≥70% (`npm run test:coverage`)
- [ ] Deployment script works (`./scripts/deploy-web.sh`)
- [ ] No `node_modules/` in git (`git ls-files | grep node_modules` returns nothing)
- [ ] No `coverage/` in git (`git ls-files | grep coverage` returns nothing)
- [ ] `genesis/` directory deleted and removed from git

---

## Step 10: Tell User ✅

- [ ] Told user: "✅ Completed: [specific actions]"
- [ ] Told user: "✅ Quality Checks: [linting, tests, coverage results]"
- [ ] Told user: "✅ Deployed: [GitHub Pages URL]"
- [ ] Told user: "✅ Deployment Script: Use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` for future deployments"
- [ ] Told user: "✅ What's Left: NOTHING - Ready to start coding!"
- [ ] Did NOT use hyperbolic language
- [ ] Was specific with numbers (X/X tests, Y% coverage)

---

## Step 11: Review Reverse-Integration Notes ✅

**CRITICAL**: Before finishing, review what you learned during this implementation.

- [ ] Check `REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md` - Did you create any notes?
- [ ] Count how many times you referenced product-requirements-assistant or one-pager
- [ ] For each reference, ask: "Should this be in Genesis templates?"
- [ ] If you referenced the same thing multiple times, Genesis is definitely missing it
- [ ] Tell user: "📝 Created [N] reverse-integration notes for Genesis improvements"
- [ ] Tell user: "🔄 Recommend sharing REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md with Genesis maintainer"

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- ✅ Did dark mode work immediately, or did you have to fix it? (If fixed: Genesis gap!)
- ✅ Did you copy code from reference implementations? (If yes: Should be in templates!)
- ✅ Did you ask questions that were answered in reference implementations? (If yes: Better docs needed!)
- ✅ Did you encounter bugs that Genesis should prevent? (If yes: Add validation!)
- ✅ Did you implement features that future projects will need? (If yes: Add to templates!)

**Example summary to give user**:
```
📝 Reverse-Integration Summary:
- Created 3 notes in REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md
- Referenced product-requirements-assistant 5 times (dark mode, workflow, deployment)
- Referenced one-pager 2 times (UI patterns)
- Recommendations for Genesis:
  1. CRITICAL: Add [specific pattern] to templates
  2. HIGH: Update [specific doc] with [specific guidance]
  3. MEDIUM: Add [specific validation] to prevent [specific bug]
```

---

## Final Self-Check

- [ ] I read START-HERE.md completely before starting
- [ ] I studied BOTH reference implementations before implementing
- [ ] I followed ALL steps in order
- [ ] I did NOT skip linting or testing
- [ ] I did NOT include build artifacts
- [ ] I proactively communicated what's left
- [ ] I created REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md and documented what Genesis is missing
- [ ] I can confidently say: "Ready to start coding"

**If ALL boxes are checked, you successfully executed Genesis. Well done!**

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Cycle

**Remember**: Genesis gets better with every project!

1. ✅ You built a project from Genesis
2. ✅ You referenced implementations when stuck
3. ✅ You documented what you learned
4. 🔄 **Next**: Share notes with Genesis maintainer
5. 🔄 **Result**: Next project is easier

**This is how Genesis evolves from good to great.**
