# AI Assistant Instructions for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**CRITICAL**: Read this file FIRST before working on this codebase.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **MANDATORY: Script-Only Deployments and Setup**

**⚠️ CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST**:

#### Deployment Rule (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
**ALL deployments MUST be performed using project scripts. NEVER use manual git commands.**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use deployment script
./scripts/deploy-web.sh

# ❌ WRONG - Manual deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy"
git push
```

**Why**: The deployment script enforces quality gates (linting, tests, coverage) before deploying. Manual deployments bypass these checks and can deploy broken code.

#### Setup Rule (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
**ALL project dependencies MUST be installed via setup scripts. NEVER tell users to run manual install commands.**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use setup script
./scripts/setup-macos.sh

# ❌ WRONG - Manual setup
npm install
brew install shellcheck
```

**Why**: Setup scripts ensure reproducible environments. Manual setup leads to "works on my machine" problems.

#### Required Setup Scripts
Every project MUST have these scripts in `scripts/`:
- **`setup-macos.sh`** - MANDATORY for all projects
- **`setup-linux.sh`** - If project supports Linux
- **`setup-windows-wsl.sh`** - If project supports Windows WSL
- **`setup-codecov.sh`** - If project uses code coverage tools
- **`deploy-web.sh`** - For web applications

### 2. **ALWAYS Complete the Full Workflow**
When asked to do a task, you MUST:
1. ✅ Complete the work
2. ✅ Lint the code (`npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`)
3. ✅ Run tests (`npm test`)
4. ✅ Verify tests pass
5. ✅ Check coverage if applicable
6. ✅ **PROACTIVELY tell the user what's left** - don't wait to be asked

**BAD**: "I've created the files."
**GOOD**: "I've created the files, linted them (0 errors), ran tests (37/37 passing), and verified coverage (73%). What's left: [specific list]"

### 3. **NEVER Include Build Artifacts**
When creating examples or templates:
- ❌ NEVER commit `node_modules/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `coverage/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `dist/` or `build/`
- ✅ ALWAYS create `.gitignore` files
- ✅ ALWAYS verify directory size before committing

### 4. **Proactive Status Updates**
After EVERY significant change:
```
✅ What I did: [specific actions]
✅ Quality checks: [linting, tests, coverage]
✅ What's left: [specific remaining tasks]
```

Don't make the user ask "what's left?" multiple times.

## 📋 Standard Workflow Checklist

### When Creating New Code
- [ ] Write the code
- [ ] Create/update tests
- [ ] Run linter: `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify all checks pass
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` if needed
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Modifying Existing Code
- [ ] Make changes
- [ ] Update affected tests
- [ ] Run linter
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Deploying
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` (NEVER manual git commands)
- [ ] Verify deployment script exists and is executable
- [ ] Let script handle linting, testing, coverage, commit, push
- [ ] Verify deployment URL after script completes

### When Adding Dependencies
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Update `./scripts/setup-macos.sh` FIRST
- [ ] Update `./scripts/setup-linux.sh` if project supports Linux
- [ ] Add dependency to package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
- [ ] Test setup script works
- [ ] Commit setup script AND package file together
- [ ] **NEVER** tell user to run `npm install` or `pip install` manually

### When Asked "What's Left?"
This means you failed to proactively communicate. Improve by:
1. Always ending responses with "What's left: [list]"
2. Being specific about remaining tasks
3. Prioritizing tasks (blocking vs. nice-to-have)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### Main Application
- `index.html` - Main application ({{PHASE_COUNT}}-phase workflow)
- `css/` - Styles (Tailwind + custom)
- `js/` - JavaScript modules (ES6)
- `tests/` - Jest unit tests
- `e2e/` - Playwright E2E tests

### Scripts (CRITICAL - ALWAYS USE THESE)
- **`scripts/setup-macos.sh`** - Install ALL dependencies (MANDATORY)
- **`scripts/setup-linux.sh`** - Linux setup (if supported)
- **`scripts/deploy-web.sh`** - Deploy to GitHub Pages (MANDATORY for web apps)
- `scripts/lib/common.sh` - Common shell functions
- `scripts/lib/compact.sh` - Compact display utilities

### Configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment template (tracked in git)
- `.env` - Actual secrets (gitignored, never commit)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - Linting rules

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- **Main application**: 85% minimum (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **UI code**: Can be excluded if E2E tested

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix
```

### Setup Commands (MANDATORY - Use These, Not Manual Install)
```bash
# Initial setup (macOS)
./scripts/setup-macos.sh

# Initial setup (Linux)
./scripts/setup-linux.sh

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
./scripts/deploy-web.sh

# Deploy with verbose output
./scripts/deploy-web.sh -v

# Deploy skipping tests (emergency only)
./scripts/deploy-web.sh --skip-tests
```

### ALWAYS Run These After Code Changes
1. `npm run lint` (or `lint:fix`)
2. `npm test`
3. Verify output shows all passing
4. **Deploy using `./scripts/deploy-web.sh`** (NEVER manual git commands)

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### NEVER
- ❌ **Deploy using manual git commands** (ALWAYS use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh`)
- ❌ **Tell users to run `npm install` or `pip install`** (ALWAYS use setup scripts)
- ❌ **Add dependencies without updating setup scripts**
- ❌ Create files without linting them
- ❌ Create tests without running them
- ❌ Commit `node_modules/` or build artifacts
- ❌ Make user ask "what's left?" multiple times
- ❌ Use hyperbolic language ("amazing", "revolutionary", "production-grade")
- ❌ Create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- ❌ Do more than the user asked

### ALWAYS
- ✅ **Use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` for ALL deployments**
- ✅ **Use `./scripts/setup-macos.sh` for ALL setup instructions**
- ✅ **Update setup scripts BEFORE adding dependencies**
- ✅ Lint after creating/modifying code
- ✅ Run tests after creating/modifying tests
- ✅ Create `.gitignore` for new directories with dependencies
- ✅ Proactively communicate what's left
- ✅ Use factual, professional language
- ✅ Ask before committing, pushing, or deploying

---

## 📝 Communication Style

### User Expectations
- **No flattery**: Don't say "great question", "excellent idea", etc.
- **Be direct**: Skip pleasantries, get to the point
- **Be specific**: "37/37 tests passing" not "tests are working"
- **Be proactive**: Always end with "What's left: [list]"

### Status Update Template
```
✅ Completed:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

✅ Quality Checks:
- Linting: PASSED (0 errors)
- Tests: PASSED (37/37)
- Coverage: 73% (exceeds 70% threshold)

✅ What's Left:
- [Specific remaining task 1]
- [Specific remaining task 2]
```

**Remember**: Match the user's high standards for professionalism and completeness.
