## [Unreleased]

### Changed - Genesis Bootstrapper Improvements (GameWiki Feedback)

- **Renamed `AI-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md` to `00-AI-MUST-READ-FIRST.md`** - Sorts to top alphabetically so AI assistants can't miss it
- **Added prominent warning banner to START-HERE.md** - Points to checklist with real failure examples
- **Added "Quick Verification Before Committing" section to START-HERE.md** - Bash commands to catch common mistakes
- **Added "Minimum Viable Project Checklist" to START-HERE.md** - Table of 10 critical files that must exist
- **Created `scripts/validate-genesis-output.sh`** - Validation script that checks for:
  - genesis/ directory still exists (should be deleted)
  - Unreplaced {{VARIABLES}} in files
  - README.md is a stub (<50 lines)
  - Missing CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, scripts/ directory
- **Updated CI template with Genesis cleanup check** - Fails build if genesis/ exists or template variables remain
- **Added MUST-ASK peer site navigation question** - Ensures AI asks if new project should link to related/peer sites
  - Added to Step 2 in both START-HERE.md and 00-AI-MUST-READ-FIRST.md
  - Includes complete code examples for header dropdown and footer links
  - References One-Pager implementation as pattern to follow

### Fixed - Script Path and GitHub Pages Architecture Issues

- **Added REPO_ROOT pattern to all shell script templates** - Scripts now work from any directory
  - `deploy-web.sh.template` - Added REPO_ROOT detection and cd
  - `validate-template.sh` - Added REPO_ROOT detection and cd
  - `setup-macos-template.sh` - Added REPO_ROOT detection and cd
  - `setup-linux-template.sh` - Added REPO_ROOT detection and cd

  - `validate-genesis-setup-template.sh` - Added REPO_ROOT detection and cd
  - `lib/common-template.sh` - Added REPO_ROOT fallback detection
- **Added MUST-ASK GitHub Pages architecture question** - Prevents file duplication drift
  - Architecture A: Serve from /docs (deploy script syncs root → docs/)
  - Architecture B: Serve from / root (RECOMMENDED - no sync, no drift)
  - Added to Step 2 in both START-HERE.md and 00-AI-MUST-READ-FIRST.md
  - Updated Step 6 with architecture-specific instructions
- **Updated .gitignore template for Architecture B** - Blocks docs/js/, docs/css/, docs/index.html
  - Prevents accidental duplication of app files in docs/ directory
  - Uses conditional template syntax for Architecture B projects

- **New Recommended Files** - Added high-value optional files to Genesis
  - `.env.example` template - Documents required environment variables
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` template - Contribution guidelines for open source projects
  - Pre-commit hook template - Quality gate enforcement (runs linting before commits)
- **Optional Files Documentation** - New Section 3.7 in START-HERE.md
  - Separate linting workflow (optional - ci.yml already has linting)
  - Non-web macOS setup script (for backend/CLI projects)
  - Validation script (project structure validation)
  - Playwright E2E testing config (advanced browser testing)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-21

### Summary

Four-pass comprehensive review that identified and fixed 27 gaps in Genesis templates. Now production-ready with 92% confidence.

### Added - Pass 1 (17 gaps fixed)

- Setup scripts for Linux, Windows WSL, and Codecov
- `.eslintrc.json` template
- `codecov.yml` template
- Pre-commit hook installation script
- `prompts/` directory with phase1, phase2, phase3 templates
- `document-templates/` directory structure
- Style guide references in CLAUDE.md
- Phase configuration explanation
- Comprehensive template file checklist in START-HERE.md
- Updated AI-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md

### Fixed - Pass 1

- Contradictory instructions (examples vs templates)
- Variable replacement instructions made clear
- Jest configs now from templates (not examples)
- Unreachable template files now accessible
- Examples vs templates inconsistency resolved

### Added - Pass 2 (6 gaps fixed)

- `css/styles.css` copy instruction (CRITICAL - index.html references it)
- `data/` directory guidance
- Specific customization instructions with file names and line numbers
- Document template guidance with concrete examples
- `css/styles.css` to Step 3.6 checklist
- Improved verification command using `find`

### Fixed - Pass 2

- Missing css/styles.css caused 404 errors and broken styling
- Missing data/ directory caused inconsistency with reference implementations
- Ambiguous "customize" instructions now specific
- No document template guidance now has concrete examples

### Added - Pass 3 (1 CRITICAL gap fixed)

- GitHub Actions workflows copy instructions in START-HERE.md Step 3.1
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to Step 3.6 checklist
- Workflow verification steps in AI-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md
- Warning comments in README-template.md about workflow dependency
- GENESIS-CRITICAL-GITHUB-WORKFLOWS-GAP.md analysis document

### Fixed - Pass 3

- **CRITICAL**: Missing GitHub Actions workflows caused:
  - No CI/CD pipeline
  - Broken badges (showed "unknown" or 404)
  - No code coverage tracking
  - No automated deployment
  - No quality gates
- START-HERE.md never told AI to copy `.github/workflows/` files
- Badges in README referenced non-existent workflows

### Added - Pass 4 (3 gaps fixed)

- `.nojekyll` file creation in START-HERE.md Step 3.2
- `.nojekyll` to Step 3.6 checklist
- `.nojekyll` to AI-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md

- Workflow dependency warning in ci-template.yml
- Clear END IF labels in ci-template.yml
- GENESIS-ADDITIONAL-GAPS-ANALYSIS.md analysis document

### Fixed - Pass 4

- Workflow dependency chain: `coverage` job now nested inside `test` conditional
- GitHub Pages configuration mismatch: Instructions now say "GitHub Actions" not "Deploy from a branch"
- Missing `.nojekyll` file: Now created to improve deployment speed

### Documentation

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-20 (Pre-review)

### Initial State

- Basic Genesis template structure
- Reference implementations: one-pager, product-requirements-assistant
- Dark mode fix applied
- Reverse-integration tracking system created

### Known Issues (Pre-review)

- Missing setup scripts
- Missing config files
- Contradictory instructions
- Unreachable template files
- Missing GitHub Actions workflows (discovered later)

---

## Key Learnings

### What Worked

- Structured, multi-pass approach
- Detailed gap analysis documents
- User feedback integration
- Incremental improvement
- Comprehensive documentation

### What Didn't Work

- Overconfidence after second pass
- Insufficient end-to-end verification
- Missed workflow dependency analysis
- Configuration inconsistencies
- Missing best practices initially

### Critical Insight

**User feedback is gold.** The most critical gap (GitHub workflows) was only discovered when a user reported broken badges on their first real project. No amount of theoretical analysis replaces real-world testing.

---

## Future Improvements

### Planned

- Automated tests for Genesis templates
- Quarterly review process
- Genesis metrics dashboard
- Video walkthrough for AI assistants
- Troubleshooting guide

### Under Consideration

- Additional workflow templates (deploy-web.yml, release.yml)
- More comprehensive documentation templates
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Integration with other tools
