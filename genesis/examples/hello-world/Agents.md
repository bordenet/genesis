## Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit:
1. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Test**: `npm test`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 70%

**Order matters.** Lint → Build → Test. Never skip steps.

---

## Communication Rules

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

**Banned phrases**: production-grade, world-class, leverage, utilize, incredibly, extremely, Happy to help!

---

## 🚨 Progressive Module Loading

**STOP and load the relevant module BEFORE these actions:**

### Language Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/javascript.md`

### Workflow Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE any commit, PR, push, or merge**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/security.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN tests fail OR after 2+ failed fix attempts**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/testing.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN build fails OR lint errors appear**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/build-hygiene.md`
- 🟡 **BEFORE deploying to any environment**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/deployment.md`
- 🟡 **WHEN conversation exceeds 50 exchanges**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/context-management.md`

### Optional: Superpowers integration

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

## Project-Specific Rules

<!-- Add project-specific guidance below this line -->

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Project Bootstrapping Checklist (When Creating New Project)

**If you are creating a new project from this hello-world template, you MUST complete these steps:**

#### 1. IndexedDB Database Name
**Files to update**: `js/storage.js`, `assistant/js/storage.js`, `assistant/tests/storage.test.js`

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Will cause data corruption with other tools!
const DB_NAME = 'hello-world-assistant-db';

// ✅ CORRECT - Unique to your project
const DB_NAME = 'your-project-name-db';
```

#### 2. Scoring_Methods.md (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS generate `docs/Scoring_Methods.md`** for your new project. This file documents the scoring methodology used by your validator.

**Template location**: `docs/Scoring_Methods.md` (this repo)

**Steps**:
1. Copy the template from `docs/Scoring_Methods.md`
2. Customize the scoring dimensions for your document type
3. Document all detection patterns from `validator/js/validator.js`
4. Add adversarial robustness notes
5. Ensure alignment with `shared/prompts/phase1.md` and `validator/js/prompts.js`

**Why**: Scoring methodology must be transparent and documented. This enables:
- Adversarial alignment reviews
- User understanding of scoring
- Maintainability of the validator

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL: IndexedDB Database Name (When Creating New Project)

**If you are creating a new project from this hello-world template, you MUST change the IndexedDB database name!**

**Files to update**:
1. `js/storage.js`
2. `assistant/js/storage.js`
3. `assistant/tests/storage.test.js`

**What to change**:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Will cause data corruption with other tools!
const DB_NAME = 'hello-world-assistant-db';
const STORE_NAME = 'projects';

// ✅ CORRECT - Unique to your project
const DB_NAME = 'your-project-name-db';
const STORE_NAME = 'your-documents';
```

**Why**: All genesis tools share `bordenet.github.io`. IndexedDB is scoped by domain, not path. Same DB_NAME = shared/corrupted data between tools.
   - Deployment scripts

2. **[product-requirements-assistant](https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant)** ⭐ **SECONDARY**
   - Dark mode toggle patterns
   - Setup scripts (fast, resumable, smart caching)

### 1. **MANDATORY: Manual Deployment After CI Passes**

**ALL deployments MUST follow this 3-step process:**

```bash
# Step 1: Push changes to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
git push origin main

# Step 2: WAIT for CI to pass
# Check: https://github.com/bordenet/YOUR-PROJECT/actions
# ⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED until all checks are GREEN

# Step 3: Deploy ONLY after CI passes
./scripts/deploy-web.sh
```

**Why**:
- CI runs comprehensive quality gates (lint, test, coverage)
- Deploying before CI passes can ship broken code
- CI is the single source of truth for code quality

#### If CI Fails:
1. Fix the issues locally
2. Push fixes
3. Wait for CI to pass
4. THEN deploy

### 2. **ALWAYS Complete the Full Workflow**
When asked to do a task, you MUST:
1. ✅ Complete the work
2. ✅ Lint the code (`npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`)
3. ✅ Run tests (`npm test`)
4. ✅ Verify tests pass
5. ✅ **PROACTIVELY tell the user what's left**

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### Main Application
- `index.html` - Main application (3-phase workflow)
- `css/` - Styles (Tailwind + custom)
- `js/` - JavaScript modules (ES6)
- `tests/` - Jest unit tests

### Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-macos.sh`** - Install ALL dependencies
- **`scripts/deploy-web.sh`** - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum thresholds**: 50% statements, 40% branches (enforced in jest.config.js)
- **UI code**: Can be excluded if E2E tested

### Test Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage # Run with coverage
npm run lint          # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues
```

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### NEVER
- ❌ Deploy before CI passes
- ❌ Create files without linting them
- ❌ Create tests without running them
- ❌ Commit `node_modules/` or build artifacts
- ❌ Make user ask "what's left?" multiple times

### ALWAYS
- ✅ Wait for CI to pass before deploying
- ✅ Use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` for deployments
- ✅ Lint after creating/modifying code
- ✅ Run tests after creating/modifying tests
- ✅ Proactively communicate what's left

---

**Remember**: CI is the single source of truth for code quality.

## Superpowers Skills

At the START of every conversation, run:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

This loads available skills. Key skills:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - Before creative/feature work
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` - Before fixing bugs
- `superpowers:test-driven-development` - Before writing implementation
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` - Before claiming done
- `superpowers:writing-plans` - Before multi-step tasks

**To load a skill:**
```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js use-skill superpowers:<skill-name>
```

**To list all skills:**
```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js find-skills
```

**The Rule:** IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK (even 1% chance), YOU MUST INVOKE IT.
