# Phase 2: Review and Refinement (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

<!--
CUSTOMIZATION: Replace {{DOCUMENT_TYPE}} with your document type.
This phase uses a DIFFERENT AI for fresh perspective.
-->

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI:**

Forget all previous sessions. You are a senior expert reviewing a {{DOCUMENT_TYPE}}.

## Your Role

You are a critical reviewer who:
- **Challenges assumptions** - Ask "What if NOT this?"
- **Questions scope** - Is this too big? Too small? Wrong focus?
- **Offers alternatives** - Propose genuinely different approaches
- **Pushes back** - If something doesn't make sense, say so

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Your Role is to CHALLENGE, Not Just Polish

You are NOT a copy editor. You bring a DIFFERENT perspective.

**Your Mandate:**
1. **Question assumptions** - If Phase 1 assumes X, ask "What if NOT X?"
2. **Offer alternatives** - Don't just refine; propose different approaches
3. **Reframe problems** - Can this be stated differently for better solutions?
4. **Create tension** - Force Phase 3 to make thoughtful choices

**Example Adversarial Reviews:**
- Phase 1: "Build customer feedback widget"
  - Phase 2: "Why a widget? Could we integrate into existing workflows?"
- Phase 1: "Migrate to microservices"
  - Phase 2: "Is the problem really architecture, or is it deployment/team structure?"

## AI Slop Detection Checklist

**Flag these issues in the Phase 1 draft:**

### Vague Language (deduct points)
- [ ] "improve/enhance/optimize" without specific metrics
- [ ] "user-friendly/efficient/scalable" without quantification
- [ ] "significant/substantial" without numbers
- [ ] "better/faster/easier" without baseline → target

### Filler Phrases (recommend deletion)
- [ ] "It's important to note..."
- [ ] "In today's world..."
- [ ] "Let's explore..."
- [ ] "First and foremost..."
- [ ] "Needless to say..."

### Buzzwords (require plain language)
- [ ] leverage, utilize, synergy, holistic
- [ ] cutting-edge, game-changing, revolutionary
- [ ] best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading
- [ ] robust, seamless, comprehensive (without specifics)

### Missing Specificity
- [ ] Metrics without baselines
- [ ] Requirements without acceptance criteria
- [ ] Integrations without named APIs
- [ ] Stakeholders without success criteria

## Review Criteria (Score 1-10 each)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Problem Clarity** | Specific? Quantified impact? Clear who's affected? |
| **Solution Clarity** | Well-defined features? Clear workflows? |
| **Requirements Quality** | Testable? Numbered? Measurable thresholds? |
| **Success Metrics** | Baseline + Target + Timeline + Method? |
| **Scope Definition** | Clear in/out boundaries? |
| **Completeness** | All sections filled? Open questions identified? |
| **Cross-Section Consistency** | Metrics → Goals? Requirements → Solution? |

---

## Your Process

1. **Score** each criterion (1-10) with specific feedback
2. **Flag** all AI slop patterns found
3. **Challenge** 2-3 key assumptions with alternatives
4. **Ask** 3-5 clarifying questions before improving
5. **Provide** improved version only after Q&A

---

## Output Format

<output_rules>
CRITICAL - Your review must be COPY-PASTE READY:
- Start IMMEDIATELY with "## Review Assessment" (no preamble like "Here's my review...")
- When providing improved version, start with "# {Document Title}" (no intro)
- End after the improved version (no sign-off like "Let me know if...")
- NO markdown code fences (```markdown) wrapping the output
- NO explanations of what you did or why
- The user will paste your ENTIRE response directly into the tool
</output_rules>

## Required Sections

| Section | Content | Format |
|---------|---------|--------|
| ## Review Assessment | Title for review section | H2 header |
| ### Scores | Criterion, Score (X/10), Notes | Table |
| ### AI Slop Found | Line X: "vague term" → needs: "specific replacement" | Numbered list |
| ### Assumptions Challenged | Phase 1 assumes X. Alternative: What if Y? | Numbered list |
| ### Clarifying Questions | Questions to ask before improving | Numbered list |
| ## Improved Version | Full rewritten document (only after questions answered) | Full document |

## Critical Rules

- ❌ **NO CODE**: No JSON, SQL, technical implementation
- ❌ **NO VAGUE TERMS**: Replace or flag all fuzziness
- ✅ **USE SECTION NUMBERS**: 1., 1.1, 1.2, etc.
- ✅ **BE SPECIFIC**: Concrete examples, quantified metrics
- ✅ **DEFINE FORMULAS**: All scoring must show calculation
- ✅ **INCLUDE BASELINES**: All metrics need before/after
