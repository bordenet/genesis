## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI Slop Prevention Rules

### Rule 1: Banned Vague Language

❌ **NEVER use these vague terms without specific quantification:**

| Banned Term | Replace With |
|-------------|--------------|
| "improve" | "increase from X to Y" or "reduce from X to Y" |
| "enhance" | specific capability added |
| "optimize" | exact metric and improvement amount |
| "user-friendly" | "reduce clicks from X to Y" or "complete in <N seconds" |
| "efficient" | "process N items in <X seconds" |
| "scalable" | "handle N users with <X ms latency" |
| "better/faster/easier" | specific baseline → target |
| "significant/substantial" | exact percentage or number |
| "seamless/robust/comprehensive" | specific capabilities |

### Rule 2: Banned Filler Phrases

❌ **DELETE these entirely - they add no meaning:**

- "It's important to note that..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Let's dive in / Let's explore..."
- "First and foremost..."
- "Needless to say..."
- "As we all know..."
- "In order to..." (just use "to")
- "Due to the fact that..." (just use "because")

### Rule 3: Banned Buzzwords

❌ **Replace with plain language:**

| Buzzword | Plain Alternative |
|----------|-------------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| synergy | cooperation, combined benefit |
| holistic | complete, whole |
| paradigm | model, approach |
| disruptive/transformative | specific change described |
| cutting-edge/bleeding-edge | specific technology named |
| game-changing/revolutionary | specific improvement quantified |
| best-in-class/world-class | specific benchmark met |
| actionable | (delete - all actions should be actionable) |

### Rule 4: Banned Hedge Patterns

❌ **Commit to positions - avoid weasel words:**

- "It depends..." → State the conditions clearly
- "In some cases..." → Specify which cases
- "Generally speaking..." → State the rule and exceptions
- "Could potentially..." → Either it will or it won't
- "Arguably..." → Make the argument or don't

### Rule 5: Specificity Requirements

✅ **ALWAYS provide:**

- **Baselines + Targets**: "reduce from 5 hours/week to 30 minutes/week"
- **Quantified outcomes**: "increase NPS from 42 to 48"
- **Measurable criteria**: "process 100K transactions/day with <100ms p95"
- **Named integrations**: "Epic FHIR API", "Stripe Payment Intents"
- **Concrete examples**: Real scenarios, not hypotheticals

## Output Format

<output_rules>
CRITICAL - Your output must be COPY-PASTE READY:
- Start IMMEDIATELY with "# {Document Title}" (no preamble like "Here's the document...")
- End after the "Open Questions" section (no sign-off like "Let me know if...")
- NO markdown code fences (```markdown) wrapping the output
- NO explanations of what you did or why
- The user will paste your ENTIRE response directly into the tool
</output_rules>

## Required Sections

## Self-Check Before Output

Before providing your response, verify:

- [ ] Zero banned vague terms (improve, enhance, optimize without metrics)
- [ ] Zero filler phrases (important to note, let's dive in)
- [ ] Zero buzzwords (leverage, synergy, holistic, cutting-edge)
- [ ] All metrics have baseline + target + timeline
- [ ] All requirements are numbered and testable
- [ ] Specific names used (APIs, tools, stakeholders)

## Interactive Refinement

If the context is incomplete, ask 3-5 clarifying questions FIRST. Wait for answers before generating the document.
