# 🚨 REPO ARCHIVED - MOVED TO DOCFORGE-AI 🚨

**This repository is read-only and no longer maintained.**

- **Why?** genesis was a prototype for document generation apps. It has been fully replaced by the production-ready, actively developed [docforge-ai](https://github.com/bordenet/docforge-ai).
- **Where to go now?** Fork, star, contribute, or use code from https://github.com/bordenet/docforge-ai (most recent commits, features, and job-description tooling).
- **Migration details:** All core logic, improvements, and new features (e.g., job-description fortification) are in docforge-ai. Historical genesis code remains here for reference.
- Last updated: 2026-02-15.

## Why "genesis"?

Named for the [Genesis Planet](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Genesis_(planet)) in *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan*, the life-creating world born from the Mutara Nebula where Spock's torpedo lands. No biblical reference intended; pure sci-fi homage to rapid, emergent creation.

## About This Project

Genesis started as an experiment: how deterministic could I make AI-assisted development? The answer: not very! I was fighting nature at every turn. Traditional architecture with AI-generated code on a short leash wins. A useful exercise that revealed how much mutation even the best AI coding agents introduce. See [BACKGROUND.md](BACKGROUND.md) for the full story.

## AI-First Development: Lessons Learned

Genesis was an experiment in deterministic AI-assisted development. The conclusion: **architecture-first design with AI iteration beats conformity tooling**.

### What the Industry Data Shows (2026)

| Metric | Finding | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Developer productivity | 26% boost from AI coding assistants | [IT Revolution][1] |
| PR cycle speed | 20-24% faster on routine tasks | [dev.to][2] |
| Complex logic | 10-19% slower due to debugging "almost-right" code | [dev.to][2] |
| Prototype velocity | 16-26% boost for MVPs (3-4 week cycles) | [Coaio][3] |
| AI adoption | 60%+ of companies using AI across multiple functions | [LinkedIn][4] |
| AI agent focus time | Doubling every 7 months (METR data) | [LinkedIn][4] |

### Core Principles That Work

- **Architecture first, AI second:** Define structure upfront, let AI handle implementation details
- **Speed vs. quality trade-offs are real:** Rapid prototyping via AI, human oversight on reliability and security
- **Context engineering matters:** Dedicated files (AGENTS.md, structured prompts) guide AI behavior better than long instructions
- **Tests as guardrails:** Comprehensive coverage catches regressions without mandating line-by-line review

### What Genesis Taught Me

Genesis pushed conformity tooling to its limits: 1,600+ commits, 9 repositories, byte-for-byte diff tools, self-reinforcing AI instructions. It worked, but the maintenance burden compounded. Every improvement required propagation to 9 derived projects.

**The better approach:** A unified codebase with plugin architecture. Shared infrastructure, isolated data, one test suite. This is [DocForgeAI](https://github.com/bordenet/docforge-ai).

## Architecture

Every genesis-tools project contains **BOTH**:

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Assistant** | 3-phase AI workflow for creating documents | `assistant/` |
| **Validator** | Score documents against quality dimensions | `validator/` |

**Shared Libraries** (copied into each project's `js/core/` directory):
- [`assistant-core`](https://github.com/bordenet/assistant-core) - UI, storage, workflow utilities
- [`validator-core`](https://github.com/bordenet/validator-core) - UI, storage, scoring utilities

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details on the paired model.

9 paired projects, each with 90%+ test coverage and CI/CD.

> **Note:** These tools currently exist as separate repositories with a shared codebase. Enterprise deployment options (monorepo, unified portal, etc.) are under consideration.

## Quick Start

### Create a New Paired Project

Follow the step-by-step guide in [`genesis/START-HERE.md`](genesis/START-HERE.md).

This creates a new project with:
- `assistant/` - 3-phase workflow app
- `validator/` - Document scorer
- Pre-configured Jest, ESLint, GitHub Actions

### Alternative: Copy Template Directly

For quick prototyping, copy the `hello-world` template:

```bash
# Copy the paired template
cp -r genesis/examples/hello-world ../my-document
cd ../my-document

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development
# Open assistant/index.html or validator/index.html in browser
```

## Shared Libraries

### assistant-core

Common utilities for all assistants:

```javascript
import { storage, workflow, ui } from './core/index.js';

// Save workflow state
await storage.saveProject({ id: 'project-1', name: 'My Document' });

// Get workflow phase
const phase = workflow.getCurrentPhase();

// Show toast notification
ui.showToast('Saved!', 'success');
```

### validator-core

Common utilities for all validators:

```javascript
import { storage, ui, copyToClipboard } from './core/index.js';

// Save validation history
await storage.saveValidation({ score: 85, timestamp: Date.now() });

// Copy to clipboard
await copyToClipboard(documentText);
```

---

## CI/CD Pattern

Each project includes the core libraries as actual files (not symlinks), so CI is straightforward:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6

  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v6
    with:
      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
      cache: 'npm'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci

  - name: Lint and test
    run: |
      npm run lint
      npm run test:coverage
```

See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for the full workflow.

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:assistant      # Assistant tests only
npm run test:validator      # Validator tests only
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report
npm run lint                # ESLint
```

**Coverage targets**: ≥70% (enforced in jest.config.js)

---

## Code Consistency Tools

Check consistency across all 9 genesis projects:

```bash
cd genesis/project-diff
node diff-projects.js --ci          # Check all MUST_MATCH files
node find-orphans.js --ci           # Find orphaned JS files
```

See [`project-diff/README.md`](project-diff/README.md) for full documentation.
